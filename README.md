# Sports_Person_Classification


## Overview
The Sports Person Classifier is an image recognition web application that uses machine learning models to classify images of sports personalities. It leverages the capabilities of Random Forest and Decision Tree Classifier algorithms for accurate classification.

## Features
- **Image Recognition**: Utilizes machine learning models to recognize and classify images of sports personalities.
- **Machine Learning Expertise**: Implements Random Forest and Decision Tree Classifier algorithms for image classification tasks. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to enhance model performance.
- **Full Stack Development**: Develops a user-friendly website using Python Flask Server for deploying the classification model.
- **Additional Skills**: Demonstrates proficiency in various areas including:
  - Image processing using OpenCV and Haar Cascades
  - Pipelining for efficient model execution
  - Expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and full-stack development
  - Problem-solving skills and the ability to create end-to-end solutions

## Usage
1. **Model Training**: Train the classification model using labeled images of sports personalities. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
2. **Flask Server Setup**: Set up a Flask server to deploy the trained model. Ensure that Flask and any necessary dependencies are installed.
3. **Web Application Deployment**: Deploy the Flask web application, allowing users to upload images for classification.
4. **Image Classification**: Users can upload images of sports personalities to the web application and receive predictions on the sports person depicted in the image.

## Requirements
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas)
- Flask
- OpenCV
- HTML/CSS (for web application frontend)

## Deployment
Ensure that the Flask server is properly configured and deployed to a hosting environment accessible to users. Monitor the application for performance and scalability as needed.
